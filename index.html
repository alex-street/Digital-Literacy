        <h3>What is mis/disinformation?</h3>
        <p>Misinformation is the spread of false information, and disinformation--a type of misinformation-- is the intentional spread of false information with malicious intent.</p>
        
        <p>
          At the individual level, misinformation can cause misunderstanding when making important social, political, or even health decisions. During the coronavirus pandemic, for example, misinformation concerning the virus inundated the internet. Among this abundance of information included claims that the ingestion of bleach would protect humans against the virus and that the vaccine would spread sickness because it contained live strains ("COVID-19 and Your Health"). False claims such as these are especially dangerous because they undermine public health measures and jeopardize individual health.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the societal level, misinformation can influence public opinion and agenda as well as destabilize populations. Targeted misinformation, for example, can sow discord between groupsâ€”such as different races, political parties, religions, and even allied countries. In 2019, a concerning European misinformation campaign attempted to degrade American-Polish relations, alleging that an American soldier from the 1st Armored Division killed a Polish soldier and fled the country (Harkins). While the American soldier pictured in the news story was real and stationed in Poland at the time, the reported events were entirely fictitious. In this case, the weaponization of misinformation enabled a bad actor to manufacture perceived fact among a foreign population, leaving the United States Army at risk of unwarranted military escalation.
        </p>
        <h3>What can be done?</h3>
        <p>
          In the battle against mis/disinformation, there currently exists fact checkers, bot detectors, source selection checklists and many other tools. These tools are great, but they are not enough to build innoculation against mis/disinformation--especially as disinformation campaigns grow in sophistication and sidestep criteria found in traditional fact checker tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to take a step back revisit the psychology behind mis/disinformation. By doing so, perhaps we will finally understand why humans are vulnerable to such manipulation.
        </p>
        <h3>What efforts already exist?</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST): A psychometrically validated measure of news veracity discernment</li>
            <li>A second item</li>
            <li>A third item</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Why are these efforts not enough?</h3>
        <p>
          These measures are too broad. While they are a good first bit of insight into potentional vulnerabilities, they don't offer us the nuanced picture we need to understand where our priorities must lie in the battle against mis/disinformation.
        </p>
        <h3>Now what?</h3>
        <p>
          We need to employ a new type of disinformation susceptibility test. It is not entirely different from those that arleady exist--in fact, it builds upon preexisting measures. However, this test takes a case study created on a specific disinformation campaign--such as Russian disinformation campaign concerning the Covid-19 pandemic-- and builds a specific test based on the characteritsics common to that particular campaign. Potentially, this method can be replicated by conducting a different case study on another event and/or actor. In turn, we will build a landscape of which campaigns and tactics Americans are most vulnerable to and why.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows us to answer questions like: why was this disinformation campaign particularly sucessful? ... Questions like these cannot be answered by the misinformation tests we have today.
